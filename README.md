This is a collection of roles that can be useful when installing an OpenShift cluster with the [assisted installer](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/openshift-assisted-installer-is-now-generally-available).

It mostly builds on, and complements the [karmab.ansible_aicli_modules](https://github.com/karmab/ansible-aicli-modules) roles.
